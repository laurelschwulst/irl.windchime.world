      just come and hang amongst the chimes. We can’t wait to see and hear what
      you all have made."<br /><br />

      The Wind Chime Festival NYC was organized by us — Ellie Hunter (artist, curator) and Laurel Schwulst (designer, writer).<br><br>
      We also had a virtual festival running around the same time. You can learn more on our <a href="http://windchime.world">main website</a>.<br><br>
